* Work by iteratively optimizing modularity in each community, building hierarchy from the bottom layer (single nodes) up to the root layer.
* Input graph(s): Can be an edgelist directory for single graph or a list of edgelist directories for multiple graphs that have some share of nodes. If given multiple graphs, will automatically perform overlapping commnunity detection.
* Overlaping vs. deep community detection: cannot detect deep hierarchical clustering (hierarchy deeper than 2 layers; in other words, not just simple community assignment) and overlapping communities at the same time; in other words, 'overlap' and 'deep' cannot be both set to true.
* Graph weight: works on both weighted and unweighted graph; does not support negative edge weight

 * Param configmodel: the configuration model implemented. default: RB

   * RB: Implements Reichardt and Bornholdtâ€™s Potts spin glass model with a configuration null model https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.016110
 * Param directed: true/false, whether a graph is directed or not (does not support half directed half undirected graph). default: false
 * Param overlap: true/false, whether or not allowing overlapping community detection. default: false Please see 'Input graph(s)' and 'overlapping vs. deep community detection' for conflicts
 * Param deep: true/false, detect hierarchy or not. default: false Please see 'Input graph(s)' and 'overlapping vs. deep community detection' for conflicts
 * Param interslice_weight: the weight on the new edge connecting same nodes shared by different graphs when multiple graphs is used. default: 0.1
 * Param resolution_parameter: resolution is an indicator of the number of communities. Since louvain build communites by iteratively merging child nodes, when the resolution parameter is high, louvain will perform this merging slowly while retaining a high number of relatively small commnities and stop merging and add the root node when number of community is still high; if the resolution parameter is low, louvain will quickly merge to a small number of relatively large communities and stop. (Short version: want more communities, use higher resolution_parameter and vice versa) default: 0.1
